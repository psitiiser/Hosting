There is a saying that 'Beautiful lies elude us the most'. One can but wonder how far-fetching this saying could be. A fistful of nerdy intellects can help us guide in our quest. They are the premise that no amount of human ingenuity can make something right.<br><br>

The 'Loser' I am talking about is Sir William Thomson (1824-1907). But most of us know him by another name, 'Sir Lord Kelvin'. Yes!! The person we are mostly acquainted with is the 'Kelvin' from the unit of Absolute Temperature Scale, 'The Kelvin Scale'. Along with others, he guided the direction of Physics in the $19^{\text {th }}$ century.

<br><br>
Now, let's return to the second part,
<br><br>

<h3>The Lost Gambit</h3>
<br><br>
It's the winter of 1967, and a physicist named Peter Guthrie Tait read a paper by Herman von Helmholtz claiming that "A Vortex ring is eternally stable in an ideal fluid." Having read so, he tried to test it on his own. He made a homemade contraption of a wooden box with a side palpable with a smack and a hole on the other side. This device would produce a vortex ring from the hole with the smoke inside it whenever it's smacked on the palpable side.
<br><br>
In January, when Tait demonstrated his device to his friend and colleague, our 'Lord Kelvin', Kelvin had a stroke of brilliance. He imagined that "as the knots in the vortex ring create various patterns, similarly all the elements could be the manifestation of the rings with various types of knots in the luminiferous Aether, a fluid which permeates all the space. "( "On Vortex Atoms" in the Proceedings of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, 1867) For example, the lightest and the most abundant element in the Universe may be the vortex ring in aether with no loops. And the base of all life might be the aether ring with the Trefoil knot.
<br><br>
This radically different picture of atoms was almost immediately and cordially accepted by numerous other physicists at the time. A staggering number of at least 60 papers were published on this model of the atom. One of which was J.J. Thompson's Master's Degree thesis, 'Treatise on the motion of vortex rings' (1883). For them, it was a fair possibility because, contrary to Dalton's picture of atoms, it was much more aligned with the general viewpoint of the physicists at that time. For them, it was easier to accept the all-arching fluid with radically peculiar properties rather than to imagine microscopic solid balls.
<br><br>
Tait, motivated by this picture of the atom, dedicated the rest of his life to the study of knots. He painstakingly investigated the nature of these knots by hand and discovered a 1-crossing, a 3-crossing, a 4-crossing, two 5-crossing, three 6-crossing and seven 7-crossing knots.
<br><br>

<h3>Downfall</h3>
<br><br>
As with any other beauty, yearning for the date of eternity yet to ravish by time, this picture had its days soon spent out. The first blow came from a Russian Chemist, Dimitri Mendeleev, who discovered that "The chemical properties of elements repeat with the increasing mass number of atoms."
<br><br>
The second blow hit the root of the theory, the Luminiferous Aether; despite the best attempts from both theoretical and experimental physicists, Aether showed no intention of revealing himself. The desperate attempt by Albert Michelson and Edward Morley experimentally sealed its fate (1887) and, theoretically, two decades later, by Albert Einstein (1905).
<br><br>
The final nail in the coffin was nailed by the person who discovered the electron with the negative elementary charges in the heart of matters, the same person who worked out the dynamics of these vortex rings a decade earlier, J.J. Thomson.
<br><br>

<h3>Retrospection</h3>
<br><br>
The whole play teaches us two very important lessons. The first one is from Richard
Feynman, "It doesn't matter how beautiful your theory is, it doesn't matter how smart you are. If it doesn't agree with the experiment, it's wrong." Perhaps this begs us to carefully examine the path of physics over the last 70 years. We have some extraordinarily ingenious, mathematically beautiful theories. Theory of Strings, Super-symmetry, Loop Quantum Gravity. Despite their stunning aesthetic beauty, they fail to verify their claims experimentally. Still, yet to be revealed.
<br><br>
The Second lesson is that no amount of work is ever inconsequential, even though it had a very wrong beginning. Although The 'Vortex Theory of Atoms will be lost before the wrath of time still, the field of Knots theory remains a most important branch in Mathematics. The theory has recently been found to have an application in chemistry and molecular biology. It turns out knots are essential to understanding our body as a whole as all the Proteins and nucleic acids form loops inside the cells, and to detangle them, we have to have a solid knowledge of Knots. In the field of chemistry, it has opened a whole new window of molecules. By trapping a specific atom inside a loop, we can create infinite molecules with very distinguished properties.
<br><br>
And thus, the Vortex keeps on whirling.
